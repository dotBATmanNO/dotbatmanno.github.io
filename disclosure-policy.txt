# gotta.no Responsible Disclosure Policy
This site is a side project, somewhere to post my introtakes (INTROoductions with my TAKE)
Through responsible vulnerability research you can help make the internet a safer place.

# Mutual Expectations
When working with me you can expect that I:
- Respond in a timely manner to your report
- Work to understand and validate your findings
- Recognize your contribution to improving the security of the site
- Acknowledge your finding on my Security Acknoledgements page if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability

# Scope
Only configuration managed by or systems operated / coded / written by myself for use for this site are in scope.
I am using cloud services to host this site, these services will have their own Policy for security research
and responsible disclosure and are not covered by this policy.

Please contact me at tor@dotbatman.com if you have any questions about scope.

# Submission of report
At a minimum, please include the following information with your initial submission:
- Vulnerability classification (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Short description
- Steps to reproduce (please be as detailed as possible; include screenshots if applicable)
- Asset/URL
- Date and time of your testing
- Preferred contact method (e.g. phone, email)
In a feature setup I will facilitate encryption of the report using a public key listed in security.txt 

# Rewards
I currently do not offer a reward in the form of money or give-aways. 
Your work and the high integrity that leads to responsible disclosure is duly respected.
I will offer a place on the Acknowledgments page: https://gotta.no/security-acknowledgments.txt

# How to Contact me
The official communication channel is via email to tor@dotbatman.com

# Ground Rules
To encourage research and to avoid any confusion between legitimate research and malicious attack, 
I ask that you attempt, in good faith, to:
- Play by the rules, including this policy any other relevant agreements
- Promptly report any vulnerability you have discovered
- Avoid breaking the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of the site and data
- Avoid violating the privacy of others
- Not engage in extortion.

# Safe Harbor
For responsible disclosure related to the parts of this site that is within 
scope I will not take legal action against you. You are expected, as always,
to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action is initiated by a 
third party against you and you have complied with this policy,
I will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in 
compliance with this policy. Alas, I am not a lawyer. 

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your 
security research is consistent with this policy, please submit 
a report through the Provided Channels before going any further.
